# Portfolio Site

This is my first attempt at building my portfolio website.
It's currently deployed at my personal website, which is nice.
I wanted to use react to build it but haven't figured out how that would compile in github
I will definitely be reworking it. Might be overkill to use a framework for something so simple but it would be easier to manage that way.
